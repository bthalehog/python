Course material for a programming and problemsolving in Python course, aimed at a Swedish target audience as a first course in programming and computer science on University level.

The course will have a high enough level to satisfy those who are familiar with another programming language and have the need to learn python.

Relased as part of a University course: https://dbwebb.se/kurser/python

The course repo is managed by a [dbwebb command line utility](https://dbwebb.se/dbwebb-cli).
